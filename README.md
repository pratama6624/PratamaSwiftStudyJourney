# Learning Swift â€“ For the Apple Ecosystem

This repository documents my structured journey to deeply learn **Swift**, Appleâ€™s official language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS development.

Although I already have experience with Swift, my learning was previously unstructured. Now, Iâ€™m following the [official Swift documentation](https://swift.org/documentation/) step-by-step to strengthen my foundation and fill in any gaps.

### What's inside:
- Code examples and experiments  
- Notes from official docs  
- Integration with the [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) framework for server-side Swift  

> Combining client-side and server-side Swift for full-stack mastery.
