# Becoming an iOS Developer

This repository documents my structured journey to mastering **Swift** — Apple's official programming language for building apps on iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

While I already have some experience using Swift, my previous learning process was unstructured and scattered. Now, I’m taking a more disciplined approach by following the [official Swift documentation](https://swift.org/documentation/) step by step — solidifying the basics and bridging all the gaps.

## Final Reward (Big Goal)

If I complete **100%** of this roadmap —  
**I'll reward myself with the latest iPhone model, no matter the price.**  
Yup. Even if it's the **most expensive one of the year**. No compromise.  
_It’s my way of saying “I earned it.”_
