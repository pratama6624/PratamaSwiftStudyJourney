# Learning Swift â€“ For the Apple Ecosystem

This repository documents my structured journey to deeply learn **Swift**, Appleâ€™s official language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS development.

Although I already have experience with Swift, my learning was previously unstructured. Now, Iâ€™m following the [official Swift documentation](https://swift.org/documentation/) step-by-step to strengthen my foundation and fill in any gaps.

### What's inside:
- Code examples and experiments  
- Notes from official docs  
- Integration with the [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) framework for server-side Swift  

> Combining client-side and server-side Swift for full-stack mastery.

3. Basic Xcode & SwiftUI/UIKit Familiarity
4. Layouting & Navigation
5. State Management & Data Flow
6. Networking (API/JSON & Codable)
7. Local Data (UserDefaults, Core Data, Keychain)
8. Authentication (Login/Register Basic)
9. Project Architecture (MVVM, Clean Code)
10. Unit Test & UI Test
11. Debugging & Profiling Tools
12. Error Handling & Logging
13. Push Notification & Background Task
14. Working with Media (Camera, Gallery, File)
15. Accessibility & Localization
16. App Lifecycle & SceneDelegate
17. App Performance Optimization
18. Working with Frameworks (MapKit, HealthKit, etc.)
19. App Store Preparation
20. TestFlight & Beta Testing
