## Road Map (Low-Level Roadmap) – Error Handling & Logging  

### Error Handling
	On Going
	
	[ ] Swift Error Basics
		[ ] Error protocol
  		[ ] Throwing functions
  		[ ] Do–try–catch
  		[ ] Rethrows
	[ ] Custom Error Types
  		[ ] Enum-based errors
  		[ ] LocalizedError
  		[ ] NSError bridging

  		[ ] Privacy levels (.public/.private)
  		[ ] Subsystem & category usage
	[ ] Print vs. OSLog
  		[ ] Why print is not for production
  		[ ] Performance comparison
	[ ] Log Levels
  		[ ] debug / info / error / fault
  		[ ] Filtering logs in Console app
	[ ] Persistent Logs
  		[ ] Save logs to file for debugging
  		[ ] Export logs for support
	[ ] Integrations
  		[ ] Combine with Crashlytics/Firebase
  		[ ] Third-party logging frameworks (SwiftyBeaver, CocoaLumberjack)
	[ ] Testing Logs
  		[ ] Verify logs in Unit Tests
  		[ ] Use assertions on logging output
